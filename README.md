# PG-Minigames

## Description
This game will be credited and inspired by Net Ninja (which will be credited later via citation). I wanted to created a simplistic game of memory cards with the change of matching the selected marvel character and finding its matching pair. This game also features a turn counter which keeps track telling the user how many turns it took them to find every character.

## Demo

This demo shows a sample of what the game would look like when running before user starts.
